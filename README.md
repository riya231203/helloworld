Title of the Project:

Student Enrollment System with JsonPowerDB

Description:

This project involves creating a web-based form for student enrollment that will utilize JsonPowerDB to store the collected data.

JsonPowerDB provides a simple and easy-to-use API for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Multi-mode Query: 
JsonPowerDB supports multiple modes of querying data, including Key-Value, Document, and Schema-free modes.
